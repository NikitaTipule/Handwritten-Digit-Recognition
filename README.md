# Handwritten Digit Recognition

RealTime DigitRecognition using keras and pygame.

## Overview

Recently Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) becomes one of the most appealing approaches and has been a crucial factor in the variety of recent success and challenging machine learning applications such as object detection, and face recognition. Therefore, CNNs is considered our main model for our challenging tasks of image classification. Specifically, it is used for is one of high research and business transactions. Handwriting digit recognition application is used in different tasks of our real-life time purposes. Precisely, it is used in vehicle number plate detection, banks for reading checks, post offices for sorting letter, and many other related tasks.

## Description

This is a Handwritten Digit Recognition application which can predict output corresponding to handwritten digit. I used CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) and sequential model of Keras for creating this predictive model.It is important to get good results so I created a sequential model in keras and traied it on 28X28 MNIST dataset. It gives very good result on handwritten digits.

The interface is created by using Pygame.

## Dataset

MNIST is a widely used dataset for the hand-written digit classification task. It consists of 70,000 labelled 28x28 pixel grayscale images of hand-written digits. The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. There are 10 classes (one for each of the 10 digits). The task at hand is to train a model using the 60,000 training images and subsequently test its classification accuracy on the 10,000 test images.
